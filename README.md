Now that that's said...

This is basic, low-brow historical rate and trend tracking. There are NO PREDICTIONS of future results.

However, if you track the slope of case rates curve for your region, your data collection is of good quality and accuracy and you keep your slope of rates negative for 'long enough,' it is reasonable to expect that your region will enter a maintenance state such as the Republic of Korea or Japan. Even if your region experienced extremely hight rates (such as Belgium, Italy and Singapore), your region can recover as others have.

From observation of these historcial trends, the challenge is not deciding when to lock down, but when to open and when to lock down again. The slope of rates graph is a good indicator of when you should or should not reopen. The curve uses the latest data available and the average lags by about 1 week. But if there is a statistically large up tick in rates, the curve will show that as soon as the data is available.

It is my opinion, that in a crisis with so many unknowns, caution and responsiveness are more crucial to success than statistical or mathematical rigor. Severely effected regions simply don't have the time to wait for analyses of thorough mathematical rigor.

"If your sample is large enough and selected properly, it will represent the whole well enough for most purposes. If it is not, it may be far less accurate than an intelligent guess and have nothing to recommend it but a spurious air of scientific precision." - How to Lie With Statistics by Darrell Huff copyright 1954.

The methods I used to construct these curves have served me well for 40 years and have been crucial to successful projects which were being overwhelmed by noisy, dare I say crappy, data.
